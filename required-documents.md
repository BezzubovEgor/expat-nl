# The list of the documents better to prepare upfront

## Initial
- Passport with sign (scans)
- Passports of relatives (scans)
- Birth certificates for every family member. Translates + and legalisation (apostiles). Amount of apositle differs from one to another. Sometimes 3 (1 for the document, 1 for the tranlsation, 1 for the fasten translation+document can), sometimes 2 (1 for the document, 1 for the translation)
- Marrige certificate (translates + legalisation) or Unmarried certificate (translates + legalisation) for those who expatriates with partner, not husband/wife.
- Contract (after offer approval process)

## For 30% ruling:
- Diploma + translate + double apostile
- Salary report/certificate for the last 2 years in English (to prove that you lived in Belarus last 2 years). **Important**: make sure you don't have there any statements that can be treated as NL-related transactions. For example Yandex.Taxi is legally based in NL Amsterdam, and taxi-related transactions may contain words "Amsterdam". This is not an issue since you have possibility to explain all those transactions, but it will lengthen the whole process.

## For school
Report of the vaccinations(translated personally)
Report cards - Relevant information about the school career of the child (if applicable, might need for some school)
